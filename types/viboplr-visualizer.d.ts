// VENDORED from the Viboplr host: src/types/pluginVisualizer.ts
//
// This plugin lives in its own repo, so it cannot import the app's sources. What
// follows is a verbatim copy of the visualizer contract — types only, no runtime.
//
// Re-sync with `npm run sync-types` when a checkout of the app sits at
// ../viboplr. Copying rather than hand-editing is the point: a hand-patched copy
// drifts silently, and nothing here would fail until a user's deck misbehaved.
// `minAppVersion` in manifest.json is what actually gates compatibility at
// install time.

// The plugin *visualizer* contract.
//
// A visualizer renders host state. It does not own it.
//
// That single rule is what makes this surface safe to hand to third parties:
// a visualizer is a pure function of (host state, user gesture), it holds no
// state anyone else depends on, and the only things it may write are the two
// gestures a playback visual naturally has — seek, and play a queue entry.
// Transport state (play/pause/volume), the queue's contents, and the library
// stay entirely with the host. A misbehaving visualizer can cost you a view;
// it can never cost you your music.
//
// Distinct from the declarative `PluginViewData` node union, which stays the
// preferred way to build anything that is a list, a form or a header — that's
// what makes plugin content look native. This is the escape hatch for genuine
// visuals, and it is deliberately narrow: the host owns the slots, the host
// owns the frame loop.
